## Installing Nix

Simply run this (entire) command in `Terminal.app`:

```console
$ curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -fsSL https://artifacts.nixos.org/nix-installer | sh -s -- install--no-confirm --extra-conf "
    extra-substituters = https://nix-cache.fossi-foundation.org
    extra-trusted-public-keys = nix-cache.fossi-foundation.org:3+K59iFwXqKsL7BNu6Guy0v+uTlwsxYQxjspXzqLYQs=
    extra-experimental-features = nix-command flakes
"
```

Enter your password if prompted. This should take around 5 minutes.

Make sure to close all terminals after you're done with this step.
