## Installing Nix

```{warning}
Do **not** install Nix using `apt`. The version of Nix offered by `apt` is more
often than not severely out-of-date and may cause issues.
```

To install Nix, you first need to install `curl`:

```console
$ sudo apt-get install -y curl
```

Then install Nix by running the following command:

```console 
$ curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -fsSL https://artifacts.nixos.org/nix-installer | sh -s -- install --no-confirm --extra-conf "
    extra-substituters = https://nix-cache.fossi-foundation.org
    extra-trusted-public-keys = nix-cache.fossi-foundation.org:3+K59iFwXqKsL7BNu6Guy0v+uTlwsxYQxjspXzqLYQs=
    extra-experimental-features = nix-command flakes
"
```

Enter your password if prompted. This should take around 5 minutes.

Make sure to close the Ubuntu terminal after you're done with this step and
start it again.
